## 🤔 Top 10 Expected Questions

**1. How accurate is it?**
→ 95% for English, 90% for multilingual. Tested on XNLI benchmark + 185 test cases.

**2. How do you handle hallucinations?**
→ We use NLI (classification) not LLM generation. Multi-source evidence for cross-verification.

**3. What about deepfakes?**
→ Multimodal modules in development. Currently focused on text (80% of misinformation).

**4. How will you monetize?**
→ Freemium + API access + enterprise licensing + training/consulting.

**5. Who are your competitors?**
→ Google Fact Check, ChatGPT, Snopes, PolitiFact. We differentiate on multilingual + cost + self-hosting.

**6. Is there demand?**
→ Yes! India has 500M+ internet users, 90% consume news in regional languages. $10B global market.

**7. Why focus on India?**
→ Largest market for regional content. Misinformation crisis. First-mover advantage.

**8. How will you scale?**
→ Docker → Kubernetes. Add caching (Redis), database (PostgreSQL), load balancing. GPU acceleration.

**9. What's your defensibility?**
→ Technical moat (multilingual NLI), network effects, first-mover advantage, production-ready.

**10. What's next?**
→ Browser extension (3 months), mobile app (6 months), multimodal verification (12 months).
